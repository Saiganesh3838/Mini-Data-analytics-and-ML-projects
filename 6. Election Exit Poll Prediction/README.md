A comprehensive survey has been conducted, capturing the perspectives of 1525 voters across various demographic and socio-economic factors. This dataset encompasses 9 variables, offering a rich source of information regarding voters' characteristics and preferences.

## Objective
The primary objective is to leverage machine learning to build a predictive model capable of forecasting which political party a voter is likely to support.
